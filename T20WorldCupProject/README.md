# T20 Cricket Score Predictor

This project is a T20 Cricket Score Predictor built using Machine Learning. The model is trained with the XGBRegressor algorithm to predict the final score of a T20 cricket innings based on real-time match parameters. 

A simple and interactive Streamlit web app has been developed to allow users to input match situations and get predictions instantly.
